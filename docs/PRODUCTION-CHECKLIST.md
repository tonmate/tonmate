## Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Validate environment configuration
npm run validate:env

# 2. Generate secure secrets
npm run setup:secrets

# 3. Run security audit
npm run security:audit
```

### Step 2: Database Preparation
```bash
# 1. Setup production database
npm run db:migrate

# 2. Deploy schema changes
npm run db:deploy

# 3. Verify database connection
npm run health:check
```

### Step 3: Security Verification
```bash
# 1. Run comprehensive security check
./scripts/security-check.sh

# 2. Verify HTTPS configuration
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# 3. Test authentication and authorization
curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

### Step 4: Performance Testing
```bash
# 1. Run load testing
npm run test:load

# 2. Monitor memory usage
npm run monitor:memory

# 3. Check response times
npm run test:performance
```

### Step 5: Deployment
```bash
# Option A: Docker Deployment
npm run deploy:docker

# Option B: Vercel Deployment
npm run deploy:vercel

# Option C: Traditional Server
npm run deploy:server
```

### Step 6: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# 1. Health check
npm run health:check

# 2. Start monitoring
./scripts/monitor.sh start

# 3. Verify all features
npm run test:e2e
```
