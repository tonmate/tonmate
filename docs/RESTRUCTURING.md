# Tonmate Project Restructuring

This document summarizes the completed restructuring of the Tonmate project to improve organization, consistency, and maintainability.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Repository Consolidation
- ✅ Git history rewritten to consolidate all commits under "Arya Sadeghy <aryasadeghy@gmail.com>"
- ✅ Repository migrated from GitLab to GitHub under the new Tonmate branding
- ✅ All references to previous branding updated throughout the codebase

### 2. Database Configuration
- ✅ Prisma schema updated to use PostgreSQL exclusively
- ✅ Environment example files standardized on PostgreSQL
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect PostgreSQL-only approach
- ✅ Migration guide created for users moving from SQLite to PostgreSQL

### 3. Project Structure Reorganization
- ✅ Scripts organized into purpose-specific directories:
  - `/scripts/deploy/` - Deployment and setup scripts
  - `/scripts/monitoring/` - Monitoring and health check scripts
  - `/scripts/maintenance/` - Backup and security scripts
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate monitoring scripts into a single solution
- ✅ Source code organized following Next.js best practices:
  - `/src/components/features/` - Feature-specific React components
  - `/src/lib/` - Consolidated library code
- ✅ Added comprehensive README files to document structure and conventions

### 4. Docker Simplification
- ✅ Created separate minimal `docker-compose.minimal.yml` for essential services
- ✅ Updated main `docker-compose.yml` with clear labeling of optional services
- ✅ Added detailed Docker documentation for deployment options

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation
- ✅ Added `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to document overall project organization
- ✅ Created directory-specific README files to explain purpose and conventions
- ✅ Developed SQLite to PostgreSQL migration guide
- ✅ Updated Docker documentation with clearer deployment options

## Outstanding Tasks

### 1. Code Consolidation
- [ ] Review and consolidate duplicate UI components
- [ ] Complete TypeScript migration for JavaScript files
- [ ] Update import paths where components were moved

### 2. Testing
- [ ] Update test paths to reflect new directory structure
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with the new organization
- [ ] Add missing tests for critical functionality

### 3. CI/CD
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflows to reflect new structure
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL service to CI testing environment
- [ ] Implement automated testing with the restructured codebase

### 4. Documentation
- [ ] Update screenshots in documentation to reflect latest UI
- [ ] Create architectural diagrams showing component relationships
- [ ] Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

## Benefits of Restructuring

The completed restructuring provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Developer Experience** - Clearer project structure makes it easier to find and modify code
2. **Better Maintainability** - Consistent organization improves long-term maintenance
3. **Enhanced Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation helps both users and contributors
4. **Simplified Deployment** - Clear deployment options for different environments
5. **Unified Technology Stack** - Standardization on PostgreSQL improves reliability
6. **Professional Repository History** - Clean, consistent commit history under proper authorship

## Recommendations

1. Complete the outstanding tasks identified above
2. Consider performing a full regression test of the application
3. Announce the restructured project and migration guide to existing users
4. Update the project website to reflect the new structure and PostgreSQL requirement
